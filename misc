I have a story to tell and this story is about, John.

Well, John here join a contest on Facebook. He uploaded one of his favorite photography pieces with hopes to win his desired gadget. The image with the grandest number of likes WITHIN 5 Days would win the contest so John needs REAL people with REAL connection to like and share his image all over Facebook.  But in the first place, John wouldn't join the contest if he can afford the gadget he is striving to win so it's given that John don't have much money.

Luckily, he can start a quick racket with the littlest possible money he has on his QuickRackets funds.

Last spring, he added $10 on his quickrackets funds through PayPal and over a week, he earned $7 more through some of the public quick rackets he participated in. He also earned $8 from the quick rackets he's been invited to participate in, which he naturally participated. In total, he's got $25 on his quickrackets funds.

He then created his own quick racket with the same quickrackets account he already have.

He come up with a perfect, descriptive title, "Like My Facebook Contest Entry".

He decided on the number of people he would want to join his campaign. Initially, he can only hire up to 30 people but he knows that he can add more anytime if he already rated at least 50% of the initial participants of his quick racket. He decided to hire at least 20 people initially though he knows he could have inputted 1 because a racket is a racket no matter how small the need is.

Next, he chose the targeted people he would want his campaign to be seen by. There's the age bracket, the country, the gender, and his own created groups of racketeers but he ended up choosing the public because it doesn't really matter in his case. Choosing the target would give personal notification invites to chosen racketeers but choosing the public would enable your racket to be seen by anyone including those who are yet to sign up.  When an unregistered visitor sign up from your racket, which he needs to if he really want to participate in your racket, then he will become under your wings or in other words, your referral which will give you a way of passively earning.

John then chose the perfect category for his campaign which falls under 'Facebook' category. Racketeers who are rated positively under John's racket will be given credit to their Facebook Quick Rackets reputation along with her added credit to his or her General Quick Rackets reputation. Reputations are visible on anybody's profile so John could use this information in the future when he decides to create a targeting racket that accounts to Facebook experts, so they say.

John proceeded to describing what needs to be done. Quick as it is, he goes on saying:

1. Like my Facebook picture at facebook.com/win-from-us/johns-image-entry
2. Share it in your own Facebook profile enabling it to public viewing.
3. Say something nice about it and tell your friends to like it, too. :D

He then proceeded with the proof he'll be needing from racketeers to verify if they've done the racket accordingly and authentically.  Here's John's list of needed proofs:

1. Provide me with your Facebook profile link.
2. Make sure that you have enabled your share of my Picture entry to public viewing so that I can still see it even if we're not friends on Facebook.

John then specifies the estimation of how many minutes his quick racket will need to be done.
John then finishes with a decision as to how much he will give every successful participating racketeers. He chose to give $0.12 for everyone who will like and share his Facebook entry with a valid proof. John calculated immensely if the price is fair because this would affect the flow of participants in his racket. If they find it too small for what needs to be done then they'll ignore it or worst, report it.

He then reviewed his campaign before submission because once it's submitted, the only thing he can edit is the price and he can only make it higher. The new price will only apply to racketeers who are yet to participate in his racket.

He was astonished as to how little money will be reserved for his racket.  The money that is reserved for a racket is called Racket Money. John knows that whenever he decides to end his racket, given the condition that he has no pending racket participation to rate, the money will always come back to his earned or deposited funds. John's racket money for "Like My Facebook Contest Entry" is just $2.454 for 20 people at $0.12 each. 

How did the system come up with this price? Well, John decided to pay $0.12 per approved racketeer so that's $2.400. Quickrackets will then charge 2.25% of this amount or $0.0027 for every racketeer that will be approved by John.

John then submitted his racket with sincere intentions as he knows that being reported to the administration would cause some serious damage to his account.

In a course of hours, John already got 10 participating racketeers.  He was prompted by the sytem to rate the participants because the participants is already half of what he needs and has made his racket to be paused.  To unpause the racket, he needs to at least rate 1 out of all participants. But it's stupid to just stop at 1 because John knows that his racket will be paused again once another racketeer participate.  What John did is he rated all of them. It's as easy as 1, 2. Yes! 1 2 only for there are only 2 options when rating a participating racketeer, it's either APPROVE or UNLIKELY. And approved racket participation is called 'done'. Approving all 10 participants left John's racket to a status of 10/20, 10 done over 20 needed. His Racket Money has now a balance of $1.2270.

He's campaign is now up and running again. And, he can now add 20 more needed participants.

John then added 20 more. He's racket's status is now 10/40. 10 done over 40 needed. $2.454 was added to his Racket Money so he now has a total of $3.6810 reserved for his racket.

Over a course of a day, John's racket's status had grown rapidly to 35/40 and was long been given the open gate to add some more needed racketeers to his racket. He can now add 40 more. John decided to add 25 more open places to his racket. Now, when will John's racket be paused again now that he has a racket status of 35/65?  Very easy, John's racket will be paused everytime the number of participants reach at least 50% of what's needed.  Now that John needs 30 more, his racket will be paused once the system recognizes that he already has 15 unrated participants. No one can see a paused racket except for the racket creator himself and that would be useless so nobody would want that.

In less than 36 hours, John now has $3.681 in his racket money and only spent $4.2945 for 35 approved racket participation, like a boss. Spent Racket Money will be charged first to Deposited Funds if it has balance so John's Current Deposited Funds is now $5.7055 from $10 and his earned funds is now $21.5200 from $15 because as his racket is running, his earnings is on a marathon, too.

John earned $6.5200 in the little time that he gave for participating quick rackets because he is running his own. He earned as much as that in less than an hour before shifting to his Boss version of rating his quick racket participants.

The racket goes on and on for days and 12 hours before the Facebook contest John is joining will end, John's racket now already has a status of 950/1200 after adding 200 more open places a good 10 hours ago when he was prompted that he already has a full 900/900. He's already ahead of 100 likes to other contestants but he wants to be sure he will end up winning.

This time he scheduled the closing time of his racket because he would no longer need it after the contest.  The system time is
